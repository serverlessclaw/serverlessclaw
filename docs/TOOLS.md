## 🦾 Skill-Based Architecture (New in 2026)

We have evolved from a static tool registry to a **dynamic Skill-Based Architecture**. This solves the "Context Window Bloat" problem where agents were overwhelmed by too many tool definitions.

### How it works:

1. **Minimal Default Toolset**: Agents start with a core set of "Essential Skills" (`recallKnowledge`, `discoverSkills`, `dispatchTask`).
2. **Just-in-Time Discovery**: If an agent needs a capability they don't have, they use `discoverSkills` to search the marketplace.
3. **Dynamic Installation**: They can then use `installSkill` to temporarily or permanently add that capability to their logic core.

### Adding a New Skill

1. Implement the tool in `core/tools/`.
2. Add the definition to `core/tools/definitions.ts`.
3. It is now automatically discoverable by all agents via `discoverSkills`.

---

## 🦾 Domain-Driven Architecture (Refactored April 2026)

The tool registry has been reorganized into four primary **Action Domains** to improve maintainability and token efficiency:

1. **Knowledge Domain** (`core/tools/knowledge/`): Registry, memory, context, and MCP/Skill management.
2. **Collaboration Domain** (`core/tools/collaboration/`): Workspace management, sessions, and agent-to-human messaging.
3. **Infra Domain** (`core/tools/infra/`): Deployment, scheduling, rollbacks, and system topology.
4. **System Domain** (`core/tools/system/`): Shell execution, git sync, health probes, and runtime configuration.

---

## 🏗️ Adding a New Tool

1. **Identify the Domain**: Choose the appropriate subdirectory in `core/tools/`.
2. **Define the Schema**: Add the tool's `JsonSchema` to the domain's `schema.ts`. Ensure `additionalProperties: false` is set.
3. **Implement the Logic**: Create a new `.ts` file or add to an existing one in that domain.
4. **Register in Domain Index**: Export the new tool from the domain's `index.ts`.
5. **Update Main Registry**: The main `core/tools/index.ts` will automatically pick up the new tool if the domain index is updated.
6. **Verify**: Run `make check` and `make test`.

### Dynamic Scoping (Evolution Sector)

Agents no longer receive all tools by default. They call `getAgentTools(agentId)` which:

1. Checks the `AgentRegistry` (Backbone + DynamoDB overrides).
2. Returns a subset of tools assigned to that specific agent.
3. Users can grant/revoke tools for any agent in the **ClawCenter** dashboard under the **Evolution** sector (`/capabilities`).

### ITool Interface

Definitions are now strictly typed using a unified `JsonSchema` interface to ensure compatibility across providers.

```typescript
export interface JsonSchema {
  /** The data type (e.g., 'string', 'object', 'array'). */
  type: 'string' | 'number' | 'integer' | 'boolean' | 'object' | 'array';
  description?: string;
  properties?: Record<string, JsonSchema>;
  required?: string[];
  items?: JsonSchema;
  enum?: string[];
  additionalProperties?: boolean;
}

export interface IToolDefinition {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  parameters: JsonSchema;
  // ...
}
```

### AI-Native Coding Standards (April 2026 Refresh)

To maximize semantic transparency for both humans and AI agents, follow these rules when defining tools:

1. **Avoid redundant indirection**: Use direct string literals (e.g., `type: 'string'`) instead of local constants like `const TYPE_STRING = 'string'`. Indirection creates "Lookup Friction" for LLMs.
2. **Strict Typing**: Always use `as const` for mock tool definitions in tests to align with the strictly typed union of schema types.
3. **Precise Descriptions**: Tool descriptions are NOT just documentation; they are **Instructions** for the LLM. Be verbose about constraints and edge cases.

## 🛡️ Protected Files

The system enforces protection via a centralized `isProtectedPath` utility. All filesystem-related tools (both local and MCP-driven like `filesystem_write_file`) block writes to these files to prevent accidental system destruction:

```
sst.config.ts
core/tools/index.ts
core/agents/superclaw.ts
core/lib/agent.ts
buildspec.yml
infra/**
```

Any attempt without explicit approval returns `PERMISSION_DENIED`. The Coder Agent **must** request `MANUAL_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` from the human on Telegram/Slack. Once approved, the agent can retry with the `manuallyApproved: true` parameter.

## 🔄 Tool Lifecycle & Optimization Strategy

To prevent "Context Window Bloat" and maintain high reasoning performance, Serverless Claw employs an autonomous **Tool Lifecycle Strategy**. This ensures agents only "see" the tools they actually need for their current task.

### The Tool Cycle

```text
       [ 1. DISCOVERY ] <-----------------------+
              |                                 |
      (discoverSkills)                          |
              |                                 |
       [ 2. INSTALLATION ]                      |
              |                                 |
       (installSkill)                           |
              |                                 |
       [ 3. EXECUTION ]                         | (6. RE-DISCOVERY)
              |                                 |
      (recordToolUsage)                         |
              |                                 |
       [ 4. MONITORING ]                        |
              |                                 |
      (Usage Analytics)                         |
              |                                 |
       [ 5. PRUNING ] --------------------------+
              |
  (selective_discovery_mode)
```

### Optimization Tiers

1. **Bootloader Phase**: Agents start with a minimal "Essential" toolset (`discoverSkills`, `recallKnowledge`, `dispatchTask`). This keeps initial token costs low and focus high.
2. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Expansion**: Agents use `discoverSkills` to find specialized local tools or external MCP capabilities only when the task requires them.
3. **Usage Tracking**: Every tool execution is recorded atomically in the `MemoryTable` via the `TokenTracker`, capturing the `count`, `successCount`, `totalDurationMs`, and estimated `totalInputTokens` / `totalOutputTokens`.
4. **Anomalous Tool Detection**: During the 48-hour strategic review, the **Strategic Planner** identifies "Anomalous Tools" (those with <80% success rate or >100k token cost in 7 days). It generates `TOOL_OPTIMIZATION` gaps to `PRUNE` or `REPLACE` inefficient capabilities.
5. **Selective Discovery Mode**: When enabled, the system automatically prunes an agent's toolset back to its "Core" defaults if it hasn't used a tool recently or if the toolset exceeds a complexity threshold.
6. **Performance-Based Routing**: When a task is dispatched, the **AgentRouter** computes a composite score for candidate agents: `CapabilityMatch * SuccessRate - (AvgTokens / 10000)`. This ensures tasks are handled by the most reliable and cost-efficient agent.
7. **MCP Server Pruning**: The **ClawCenter Dashboard** provides usage analytics for MCP servers, allowing humans or the SuperClaw to `unregisterMCPServer` if it's no longer providing value to the system.

### Performance Impact

- **Context Reduction**: Up to 70% reduction in system prompt size.
- **Reasoning Accuracy**: Significant reduction in "Tool Confusion" (LLM picking the wrong tool) by limiting choices.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lower input token costs due to smaller tool definitions.

## 🛡️ MCP Reliability & Transport (May 2026 Refresh)

To ensure tools are always available even in unstable network conditions or Lambda cold-starts, the system employs a **Layered Transport Architecture**.

```text
    [ Call Tool ]
          |
    +-----v-----+
    |  MCP Hub  | (Primary - SSE)
    |  (Remote) | [5s Timeout]
    +-----+-----+
          |
    (Fail / Timeout)
          |
    +-----v-----+
    | Local NPX | (Fallback - Stdio)
    | (Lambda)  | [30s Timeout]
    +-----------+
```

### Reliability Guardrails:

1. **Physical Resource Headroom**: Agents running MCP tools require `LARGE` (2048MB) memory to avoid OOM crashes during `npx` installations.
2. **Persistence Safeguards**: Any "Connection Interrupted" message is preserved in the UI even during background session refreshes.
3. **Environment Hardening**: Writable cache paths in `/tmp` prevent `npm` from crashing when attempting to write to the read-only Lambda home directory.
